        <h2>Profile Summary</h2>
           <p>Hello, I’m Samruddha Kalyankar, and i am passionate about Software Development and AIML.

I’ve had the chance to work on exciting projects like a smart traffic management system using Arduino to optimize traffic flow and Covid Detector tool during the Smart India Hackathon. These experiences sharpened my coding, problem-solving, and teamwork skills while fueling my curiosity for building impactful solutions.

I’m keen on exploring web development, where I can leverage my growing knowledge of Full Stack technologies and keep learning. Recently, I’ve started diving into Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, inspired by their ability to transform the applications I hope to create. Always eager to learn and contribute, I’m excited about the journey ahead!</p>
